## **Project Overview**
This project involves implementing an autonomous navigation system using ALOAM (A LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) and ROS (Robot Operating System). The system allows for two modes of control: manual joystick control for navigation and autonomous map-building in real-world environments.

The system integrates sensor data (LiDAR and IMU) for odometry and real-time mapping, enabling the vehicle to autonomously navigate and build maps of its surroundings.

## **Key Features**
- **Manual Control**: Using a joystick for real-time vehicle control.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The vehicle autonomously builds a map of the environment as it navigates.
- **Real-World Testing**: Successfully tested in various real-world environments, showcasing reliable map-building and navigation.

## **Technologies Used**
- **ALOAM**: A LiDAR odometry and mapping algorithm that enables real-time motion tracking and mapping.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: Provides the middleware for controlling the vehicle and handling sensor data.
- **LiDAR & IMU Sensors**: Used for precise measurement of the environment and vehicle position.

## **Contribution**
- Integrated ALOAM with ROS for seamless vehicle control.
- Developed algorithms to process LiDAR and IMU data in real-time.
- Tested and validated the system in outdoor environments, ensuring robust performance.

## **Outcome**
- Successful demonstration of autonomous navigation and map-building capabilities.
- Captured vehicle movement in real-time (see GIF below).
