I am an undergraduate researcher at Zhejiang University, majoring in Agricultural Engineering, with a minor in Advanced Class of Engineering Education(ACEE). I have broad interests in information theory, sparse reconstruction, and geometric machine learning.

My research explores how sparse and operator-based representations can bridge physical systems and computational intelligence.
My trajectory evolves from communication inference and information recovery to operator learning and world modeling, aiming to uncover universal principles of reconstructability across systems—from physical sensors to geometric scenes.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
